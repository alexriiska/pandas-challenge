Trend Number 1

Charter schools have better student performance than district schools for the sample data. This is illustrated by the Charter school's much higher math, reading, and overall passing %s. Charter school's have a 36% higher overall passing rate. This trend is likely due to the fact that Charter schools have a much smaller student population compared to District schools. As a result, students at Charter schools likely benefit from having a lower teacher:student ratio than their District peers.

Trend Number 2

Overall Passing Rates for students increase as per student spending decreases in the sample data. This is interesting because one may think that increasing per student spending would actually increase overall pass rate as well as math and reading pass rates. It is also important to note that all of the schools that fall into the group with <$585 per student spending are Charter schools. Aforementioned, charter school students likely benefit from having a lower teacher:studnet ratio due to smaller student populations.
